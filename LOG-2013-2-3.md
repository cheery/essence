Alhough the editor is messy and buggy, I feel this project is starting to approach a breakthrough!

The ./edit -script is not boring to watch anymore. It understands some commands and is capable of travelling around in the structure and has some capability at preserving language semantics

Within few days I can see whether my revised designs stand up. If that happens, I will have finally solved how to provide generic layouting and command processing for structured languages and editors.
