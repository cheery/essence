Things to do:

-># yank and tune layouter
-># yank file format and readjust it

-># add multisample texture support just to notice you don't need it
-># add framebuffer support since rendering everything all the time is slow.
-># put in placeholder layouter
-># implement nice frame system
-># implement mutator
-># implement proxy
-># implement overlay function for selection.
-># redesign intron, markers and offset retrieval.
-># implement generic mode

-> implement your input schema
-> implement tiledtext input schema and credit it's author
-> implement .mk_template and .autospawn

- bind layouter to the interpreter
- provide macron layouter

- add more things to do if needed
- start working on the llvm-backed language...
