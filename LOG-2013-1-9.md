I thought I had abandoned essence but I could not stop being unsatisfied about representing everything in my code with plain text or writing complicated parsers to read text. I cannot keep going without investing time into progress that I find essential.

I also thought about a name change, but I realise I already find structural editing essential for retaining my interest in programming.

I need to get forward.
