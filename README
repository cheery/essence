== Dependencies ==

You need casuarius and pygame to run the editor.

== How Does the Editor Function? ==

The commandline syntax to start it is:

    python editor.py [filename]

If a filename is given and it exists, the editor attempts to load the file.
In case of failure it will likely crash. Otherwise, a window appears.

== Keybindings ==

=== Navigation ===

For navigation commands you can keep shift down, and it will select the elements.

    up              walk to the last node boundary
    down            walk to the next node boundary
    left            walk to the last boundary
    right           walk to the next boundary

=== Traversal (Navigation) ===

    enter           descends to an element under cursor, goes to the first node boundary within element
    ^enter          descends to the last node boundary within element
    space           ascends from the element
    ^space          ascends from the element, but from front side

=== System ===

    C-s             Saves the document with it's filename
    C-q             quits the document if not modified
    C-Q             quits without saving the document

=== Modification ===

    C-u             undo last action
    C-r             redo last undoed action

    C-a             select all

    C-y             yank the selection
    C-delete        yank and delete the selection
    C-insert        insert the selection over existing selection

    tab             builds an element from the selection, with tag 'unk'
    delete          delete selection or next symbol|node
    backspace       delete selection or last symbol|node
