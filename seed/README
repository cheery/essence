the last editor design made me realise the editor needs to
grow alongside when real requirements appear. Seed is the
next version, which is developed to this rule.

Fundamentals of seed research:
    - produce smallest useful thing
    - do not worry about ANY features you do not need right now
    - keep rebuilding layouting engine around true requirements
    - rebuild input around true requirements

Things to do:
    - put Frame listen the document it is layouting.
