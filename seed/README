the last editor design made me realise the editor needs to
grow alongside when real requirements appear. Seed is the
next version, which is developed to this rule.

Fundamentals of seed research:
    - produce smallest useful thing
    - do not worry about ANY features you do not need right now
    - keep rebuilding layouting engine around true requirements
    - rebuild input around true requirements

Things to do:
    - put Frame listen the document it is layouting.


Things to try out:
    python main.py strike_test.flat

    click on the document with mouse to select objects
    ctrl + a = selects all
    left/right, possibly with shift = modify selection. with ctrl, move in leafs
    type character inside a string object = insert text
    type character outside a string object = generate object that can hold text
    backspace/delete = delete selection
    type '=' = spawn assignment
    type '(' = spawn call
    type alt+r = spawn return
    space = jump to next slot
    ctrl + s = save to scratch.flat

    type: python strikec.py to run. (you need llvmpy installed)
